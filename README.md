### BuffBot Vision Scripts

This repo was meant to hold all of the scripts that we use to train, test and iterate on our computer vision system. As of the 2022 season, we are using the [YOLOv5 model](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to perform object detection on the [Luxonis OAK-D](https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/). While the models are trained in pytorch, since the forward pass is performed on the camera, we have to translate the weights to a weird OpenVINO blob format. [Here is a colab notebook that does that](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/blob/master/colab-notebooks/YoloV5_training.ipynb)
